       createuser creates a new PostgreSQL user (or more precisely, a role). Only superusers and users
       with CREATEROLE privilege can create new users, so createuser must be invoked by someone who
       can connect as a superuser or a user with CREATEROLE privilege.

       If you wish to create a new superuser, you must connect as a superuser, not merely with
       CREATEROLE privilege. Being a superuser implies the ability to bypass all access permission
       checks within the database, so superuserdom should not be granted lightly.

       createuser is a wrapper around the SQL command CREATE ROLE (CCRREEAATTEE__RROOLLEE(7)). There is no
       effective difference between creating users via this utility and via other methods for
       accessing the server.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       createuser accepts the following command-line arguments:

       _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
           Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL user to be created. This name must be different from
           all existing roles in this PostgreSQL installation.

       --cc _n_u_m_b_e_r
       ----ccoonnnneeccttiioonn--lliimmiitt==_n_u_m_b_e_r
           Set a maximum number of connections for the new user. The default is to set no limit.

       --dd
       ----ccrreeaatteeddbb
           The new user will be allowed to create databases.

       --DD
       ----nnoo--ccrreeaatteeddbb
           The new user will not be allowed to create databases. This is the default.

       --ee
       ----eecchhoo
           Echo the commands that createuser generates and sends to the server.

       --EE
       ----eennccrryypptteedd
           This option is obsolete but still accepted for backward compatibility.

       --gg _r_o_l_e
       ----rroollee==_r_o_l_e
           Indicates role to which this role will be added immediately as a new member. Multiple roles
           to which this role will be added as a member can be specified by writing multiple --gg
           switches.

       --ii
       ----iinnhheerriitt
           The new role will automatically inherit privileges of roles it is a member of. This is the
           default.

       --II
       ----nnoo--iinnhheerriitt
           The new role will not automatically inherit privileges of roles it is a member of.

       ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee
           Prompt for the user name if none is specified on the command line, and also prompt for
           whichever of the options --dd/--DD, --rr/--RR, --ss/--SS is not specified on the command line. (This
           was the default behavior up to PostgreSQL 9.1.)

       --ll
       ----llooggiinn
           The new user will be allowed to log in (that is, the user name can be used as the initial
           session user identifier). This is the default.

       --LL
       ----nnoo--llooggiinn
           The new user will not be allowed to log in. (A role without login privilege is still useful
           as a means of managing database permissions.)

       --PP
       ----ppwwpprroommpptt
           If given, createuser will issue a prompt for the password of the new user. This is not
           necessary if you do not plan on using password authentication.

       --rr
       ----ccrreeaatteerroollee
           The new user will be allowed to create new roles (that is, this user will have CREATEROLE
           privilege).

       --RR
       ----nnoo--ccrreeaatteerroollee
           The new user will not be allowed to create new roles. This is the default.

       --ss
       ----ssuuppeerruusseerr
           The new user will be a superuser.

       --SS
       ----nnoo--ssuuppeerruusseerr
           The new user will not be a superuser. This is the default.

       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Print the createuser version and exit.

       ----rreepplliiccaattiioonn
           The new user will have the REPLICATION privilege, which is described more fully in the
           documentation for CREATE ROLE (CCRREEAATTEE__RROOLLEE(7)).

       ----nnoo--rreepplliiccaattiioonn
           The new user will not have the REPLICATION privilege, which is described more fully in the
           documentation for CREATE ROLE (CCRREEAATTEE__RROOLLEE(7)).

       --??
       ----hheellpp
           Show help about createuser command line arguments, and exit.

       createuser also accepts the following command-line arguments for connection parameters:

       --hh _h_o_s_t
       ----hhoosstt==_h_o_s_t
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the value begins
           with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket.

       --pp _p_o_r_t
       ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t
           Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is
           listening for connections.

       --UU _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
       ----uusseerrnnaammee==_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
           User name to connect as (not the user name to create).

       --ww
       ----nnoo--ppaasssswwoorrdd
           Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a
           password is not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
           will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to
           enter a password.

       --WW
       ----ppaasssswwoorrdd
           Force createuser to prompt for a password (for connecting to the server, not for the
           password of the new user).

           This option is never essential, since createuser will automatically prompt for a password
           if the server demands password authentication. However, createuser will waste a connection
           attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing --WW
           to avoid the extra connection attempt.

       This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables
       supported by libpq (see Section 33.14).

       In case of difficulty, see CREATE ROLE (CCRREEAATTEE__RROOLLEE(7)) and ppssqqll(1) for discussions of
       potential problems and error messages. The database server must be running at the targeted
       host. Also, any default connection settings and environment variables used by the libpq
       front-end library will apply.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       To create a user joe on the default database server:

           $ ccrreeaatteeuusseerr jjooee

       To create a user joe on the default database server with prompting for some additional
       attributes:

           $ ccrreeaatteeuusseerr ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee jjooee
           Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) nn
           Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) nn
           Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) nn

       To create the same user joe using the server on host eden, port 5000, with attributes
       explicitly specified, taking a look at the underlying command:

           $ ccrreeaatteeuusseerr --hh eeddeenn --pp 55000000 --SS --DD --RR --ee jjooee
           CREATE ROLE joe NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;

       To create the user joe as a superuser, and assign a password immediately:

           $ ccrreeaatteeuusseerr --PP --ss --ee jjooee
           Enter password for new role: xxyyzzzzyy
           Enter it again: xxyyzzzzyy
           CREATE ROLE joe PASSWORD 'md5b5f5ba1a423792b526f799ae4eb3d59e' SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;

       In the above example, the new password isn't actually echoed when typed, but we show what was
       typed for clarity. As you see, the password is encrypted before it is sent to the client.
